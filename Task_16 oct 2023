# Input the numerical score
# Write a program that calculates and displays the letter grade for a given numerical score (e.g., A, B, C, D, or F) based on the following grading scale:
#
# input- score - 89
# output- B
#
# A: 90-100
# B: 80-89
# C: 70-79
# D: 60-69
# F: 0-59
#
# If, elif, else

score = int(input("Enter the numerical score: \n"))

# Calculate the letter grade
if score >= 90 and score <= 100:
    grade = 'A'
elif score >= 80 and score < 90:
    grade = 'B'
elif score >= 70 and score < 80:
    grade = 'C'
elif score >= 60 and score < 70:
    grade = 'D'
else:
    grade = 'F'

# Display the letter grade
print("The letter grade is:", grade)




# Task #2
#
# ✅ Leap Year Checker:
#
# Create a program that determines whether a given year is a leap year.
#
# A leap year is divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless it is also divisible by 400.
#
# Use an if-else statement to make this determination.
#
#
# Input = 2024
#
# Output = Leap year

# Input the year

year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

# Check if it's a leap year
if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
    print("Leap year")
else:
    print("Not a leap year")




# Task #3
#
# ✅ Triangle Classifier:
#
# Write a program that classifies a triangle based on its side lengths.
#
# Given three input values representing the lengths of the sides, determine if the triangle is equilateral (all sides are equal), isosceles (exactly two sides are equal), or scalene (no sides are equal).
#
# Use an if-else statement to classify the triangle.
#
#
# 3 Input
#
# side 1, side 2 and side 3
#
# output - Eq, Iso, Scalene -
#
# Eq. =  side 1 == side 2 = side 3

# Input the side lengths of the triangle

side1 = float(input("Enter the length of side 1: "))
side2 = float(input("Enter the length of side 2: "))
side3 = float(input("Enter the length of side 3: "))

# Check for triangle classification
if side1 == side2 == side3:
    classification = "Eq."
elif side1 == side2 or side1 == side3 or side2 == side3:
    classification = "Iso"
else:
    classification = "Scalene"

# Display the triangle classification
print("Triangle classification:", classification)
